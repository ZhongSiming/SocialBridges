# ML for Pollution Concentration
 This project is part of my PhD dissertation. This project is attempting to use quantitative methods, including machine learning techniques, to identify and quantify how bridges interact with the people who live near them.

 My primary advisor is Dr. Daniel Armanios, Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I'm also working on this project with Dr. Kun Zhang, Philosophy, CMU.

 The physical infrastructure data came from Pennsylvania Department of Transportations's (PennDOT) Bridge Management System 2 (BMS2) (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation 2018) and OpenStreetMaps street network data hosted by Geofabrik GmbH (“Geofabrik Download Server” 2018). Only the latest measures are preserved. The authors compiled total counts of bridges by underclearance height and counts of new bridges built in the current census period (10 years) by these aforementioned types. An important boundary condition is that these are exclusively highway bridges and underclearances are only reported if there is a road or railway beneath the bridge (under record) (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation 2018 pp. 3-36-3–42).  

 The social demographic data comes from the Neighborhood Change Database (NCdB) from 1970-2010 (GeoLytics 2018). These two data sources compile a total of 36,986 bridges in 3,217 census tracts.
